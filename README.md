üß™ An almost-functional complete, minimum-viable implementation of the quantum-aware k-LUT mapping algorithm by [G. Meuli et al., ROS: Resource-constrained Oracle Synthesis for Quantum Computers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00211).

‚ö†Ô∏è This repository is a part of Homework #3 of the course **EEE 5065: Special Topics in Quantum Design Automation** taught in Fall, 2023 in Graduate Institute of Electric Engineering, National Taiwan University. The implementation is for educational purposes rather than an efficient implementation.

‚ö†Ô∏è Some part of the code is intentionally left incomplete. We have provided instructions in the code to guide you to complete the code. Search for `TODO` in the code to find the instructions.
